# pattern_machine

Welcome to a messy prototype of the autocorrelation mosaicing code.

This is included as a (very) small gesture towards basic reproducibility,
but for an updated, bugfixed version with fewer deadline-driven hacks,
contact the submitter of this paper after the end of the anonymous review period.

This code was extracted from the repository using the command
```shell
git archive --format=zip --prefix=git-docs/ HEAD:Documentation/
```
